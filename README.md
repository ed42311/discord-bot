# Discord Bot

   This is a little discord bot with `discord.js`.  It's a decent build with a few commands.  You will need `node` and `npm` on your machine then you can just start it up with `node index.js`

   You will need your own key and command prefix.  the `config.example.json` file can be renamed `config.json` and token and prefix can be added.
